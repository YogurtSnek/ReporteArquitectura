                    Fun fact: During Ayaka's arduos training, she was able to to defeat an opponent with a single strike of her 
                    elegant blade. In that instant, as she stood in the middle of the dojo, icy flowers condensed all about her. 
                    And there, upon the tip of her sword, now hung a Vision, icy and bright.
                </p>

                <p>
                    She is in charge of the internal and external affairs of the Kamisato Clan and is the younger sister 
                    of Kamisato Ayato. Beautiful, dignified, and noble, Ayaka has earned the title Shirasagi Himegimi and is 
                    considered a model of perfection in Inazuma.

                    <br><br>

                    Ayaka is a kind-hearted girl with a pleasant temperament who treats others with politeness and courtesy. 
                    She holds the people of Inazuma dear to her heart and often goes out of her way to personally assist in 
                    all kinds of matters; being a member of the Yashiro Commission, she feels that she must meet the people's needs. 
                    She is a perfectionist with an earnest personality. Her dedication often moves people, and those close to 
                    her gave her the honorary title of Shirasagi Himegimi (Japanese: 白しら鷺さぎの 姫ひめ君ぎみ Shirasagi no Himegimi, 
                    "White Heron Princess"). People in the neighborhood always talk about her with sincere admiration.

                    <br><br>

                    Thanks to the influence of Ayaka's excellent upbringing, her heart is as pure as crystallized ice. 
                    Just like the splendid colors reflected as the ice crystals spin in the winter air, such is Ayaka's spirit. 
                    While the people of Inazuma love her, it is also well known that she has very few friends due to her upbringing 
                    — Thoma is her only known friend until she met the Traveler. She is also busy to the point that she doesn't 
                    have much free time, to begin with, so she has trouble mingling with others. When not burdened with her duties, 
                    she shows a tender, cute side to her.

                    <br><br>

                    But if you want to capture a heart hanging high in the sky, you must have the ability to climb up the clouds. 
                    In other words, Ayaka is eager to associate with people capable of achieving great feats — in her eyes, 
                    friendships are dictated by fate, the same way she was destined to wield her frost-covered sword.
